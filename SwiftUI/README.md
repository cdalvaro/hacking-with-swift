3. Go back to project 2 and create a `FlagImage()` view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had. [Code](Projects/GuessTheFlag)

## [Day 25](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/25) - MILESTONE: Projects 1-3

Your challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at _rock, paper, scissors_.

So, very roughly:

- Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
- Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
- The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
- If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
- The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.

So, if the app chose _“Rock”_ and _“Win”_ the player would need to choose _“Paper”_, but if the app chose _“Rock”_ and _“Lose”_ the player would need to choose _“Scissors”_.

[Code](Milestones/Milestone-Projects1_3)

## [Day 26](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/26) - Project 4, Part One

- Entering numbers with `Stepper`.
- Selecting dates and times with `DatePicker`.
- Working with dates.
- Training a model with [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml).

[Code](Projects/BetterRest)

## [Day 27](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/27) - Project 4, Part Two

- Building a basic layout.
- Connecting SwiftUI to [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml).
- Cleaning up the user interface.

[Code](Projects/BetterRest)

## [Day 28](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/28) - Project 4, Part Three

- Replace each `VStack` in our form with a `Section`, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the `VStack` layout? It’s your app – you choose!
- Replace the _“Number of cups”_ stepper with a `Picker` showing the same range of values.
- Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the _“Calculate”_ button entirely.

[Code](Projects/BetterRest)

## [Day 29](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/29) - Project 5, Part One

- Introducing `List`, your best friend
- Loading resources from your app bundle
- Working with strings

[Code](Projects/WordScramble)

## [Day 30](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/30) - Project 5, Part Two

- Validating words with `UITextChecker`

[Code](Projects/WordScramble)

## [Day 31](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/31) - Project 5, Part Three

- Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
- Add a toolbar button that calls `startGame()`, so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
- Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player's score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.

[Code](Projects/WordScramble)

## [Day 35](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/35) - MILESTONE: Projects 4-6

Your goal is to build an _“edutainment”_ app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – _“what is 7 x 8?”_ and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.

Breaking it down:

- The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an _“Up to…”_ stepper, going from 2 to 12.
- The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
- You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.

[Code](Milestones/Milestone-Projects4_6)

## [Day 36](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/36) - Project 7, Part One

- Why [`@State`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state) only works with structs
- Sharing SwiftUI state with [`@StateObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stateobject) (:octocat: [`baee648`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/baee648aecafd58e645907b8ada0c31fd5106d31))
- Showing and hiding views (:octocat: [`2f08039`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/2f08039dce6a699410d71a9ca2458685143445fb))
- Deleting items using [`onDelete()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/foreach/ondelete(perform:)) (:octocat: [`d394d13`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/d394d13fdee94f9f4a0417c7916c6fd6a0cbb529))
- Storing user settings with [`UserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) (:octocat: [`01b7a86`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/01b7a8685fc160ba094c6b3c89557c8c1ac04a46))
- Archiving Swift objects with [`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) (:octocat: [`6dc754f`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/6dc754fce5f7329d0cb1aa4449e9b9937d631a5d))

[Code](Projects/iExpense)

## [Day 37](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/37) - Project 7, Part Two

- Building a list we can delete from
- Working with [`Identifiable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/identifiable) items in SwiftUI
- Sharing an observed object with a new view
- Making changes permanent with [`UserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults)
- Final polish (:octocat: [`6578f09`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/6578f096dc1abc6ed44d7105a1a682347404797a))

[Code](Projects/iExpense)

## [Day 38](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/38) - Project 7, Part Three

1. Use the user’s preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars. (:octocat: [`659659b`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/659659b96b170311e739daf3cd7a5efc438b4e08))
2. Modify the expense amounts in `ContentView` to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you. (:octocat: [`e4f8c49`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/e4f8c4920911436331edefd856596718a03f58f8))
3. For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means being careful about how items are deleted! (:octocat: [`d8cd46d`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/d8cd46d7553ac1bdb8fe46c0db927c5efebeae7c))

- Using generics to load any kind of [`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) data (:octocat: [`b38e78e`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/b38e78ecac1d55ae8aac0e012509a0b345916168))
- Formatting our mission view (:octocat: [`6619ae8`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/6619ae84b90bcf43e8b53db8332a53542b05957f))

[Code](Projects/Moonshot)

## [Day 41](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/41) - Project 8, Part Three

- Showing mission details with [`ScrollView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scrollview) and [`GeometryReader`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/geometryreader) (:octocat: [`a345c25`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/a345c25da6409124b18acdc82259d991eee170b3))

[Code](Projects/Moonshot)

## [Day 42](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/42) - Project 8, Part Four

1. Add the launch date to `MissionView`, below the mission badge. You might choose to format this differently given that more space is available, but it’s down to you. (:octocat: [`6195c6e`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/6195c6e2c3543fec2ae1def13c17cf5688d491be))
2. Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in `MissionView` is a great candidate, but if you followed my styling then you could also move the `Rectangle` dividers out too. (:octocat: [`6a4d7bc`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/6a4d7bcbffd6fd22764a6d250ff51f9087c228d5))

## [Day 46](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/46) - Project 9, Part Four

1. Create an `Arrow` shape – having it point straight up is fine. This could be a rectangle/triangle-style arrow, or perhaps three lines, or maybe something else depending on what kind of arrow you want to draw. (:octocat: [`5326dfd`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/5326dfd23390c434242e505c2f6ea7fd9f4e8e37))
2. Make the line thickness of your `Arrow` shape animatable. (:octocat: [`18997eb`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/18997eb837bcc4b65f409428e27d82f9632bf286))
3. Create a `ColorCyclingRectangle` shape that is the rectangular cousin of `ColorCyclingCircle`, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using one or more properties.

## [Day 51](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/51) - Project 10, Part Three

- Encoding an [`ObservableObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject) class. (:octocat: [`69c4a88`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/69c4a88b45e8cf6670306c5eb35d8b85cce379b0))

[Code](Projects/CupcakeCorner)

## [Day 52](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/52) - Project 10, Part Four

1. Our address fields are currently considered valid if they contain anything, even if it’s just only whitespace. Improve the validation to make sure a string of pure whitespace is invalid. (:octocat: [`bf20e2c`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/bf20e2c3d148b1418c8f5dbcd7a7337fb7ce880a))
2. If our call to `placeOrder()` fails – for example if there is no internet connection – show an informative alert for the user. To test this, try commenting out the `request.httpMethod = "POST"` line in your code, which should force the request to fail. (:octocat: [`5c46e59`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/5c46e59e11a4603b33abf9098ddc82404af9566b))
3. For a more challenging task, see if you can convert our data model from a class to a struct, then create an [`ObservableObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject) class wrapper around it that gets passed around. This will result in your class having one [`@Published`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published) property, which is the data struct inside it, and should make supporting [`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable/) on the struct much easier. (:octocat: [`7053dc9`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/7053dc91940c73e74171c23aaaca8c65101b3259))
