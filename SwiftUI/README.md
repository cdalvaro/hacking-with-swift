## [Day 21](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/21) - Project 2, Part Two

- Stacking up buttons
- Showing the player's score with an alert
- Styling our flags

[Code](Projects/GuessTheFlag)

## [Day 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/22) - Project 2, Part Three

_Challenge_

1. Add an `@State` property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert.
2. Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags.
3. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message.

[Code](Projects/GuessTheFlag)

2. Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip. [Code](Projects/WeSplit)
3. Go back to project 2 and create a `FlagImage()` view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had. [Code](Projects/GuessTheFlag)

## [Day 25](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/25) - MILESTONE: Projects 1-3

Your challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at _rock, paper, scissors_.

So, very roughly:

- Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
- Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
- The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
- If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
- The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.

So, if the app chose _“Rock”_ and _“Win”_ the player would need to choose _“Paper”_, but if the app chose _“Rock”_ and _“Lose”_ the player would need to choose _“Scissors”_.

[Code](Milestones/Milestone-Projects1_3)

## [Day 26](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/26) - Project 4, Part One

- Entering numbers with `Stepper`.
- Selecting dates and times with `DatePicker`.
- Working with dates.
- Training a model with [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml).

[Code](Projects/BetterRest)

## [Day 27](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/27) - Project 4, Part Two

- Building a basic layout.
- Connecting SwiftUI to [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml).
- Cleaning up the user interface.

[Code](Projects/BetterRest)

## [Day 28](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/28) - Project 4, Part Three

- Replace each `VStack` in our form with a `Section`, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the `VStack` layout? It’s your app – you choose!
- Replace the _“Number of cups”_ stepper with a `Picker` showing the same range of values.
- Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the _“Calculate”_ button entirely.

[Code](Projects/BetterRest)

## [Day 29](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/29) - Project 5, Part One

- Introducing `List`, your best friend
- Loading resources from your app bundle
- Working with strings

[Code](Projects/WordScramble)

## [Day 30](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/30) - Project 5, Part Two

- Validating words with `UITextChecker`

[Code](Projects/WordScramble)

## [Day 31](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/31) - Project 5, Part Three

- Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
- Add a toolbar button that calls `startGame()`, so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
- Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player's score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.

[Code](Projects/WordScramble)

## [Day 32](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/32) - Project 6, Part One

- Creating implicit animations
- Customizing animations in SwiftUI

[Code](Projects/GuessTheFlag)

## [Day 35](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/35) - MILESTONE: Projects 4-6

Your goal is to build an _“edutainment”_ app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – _“what is 7 x 8?”_ and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.

Breaking it down:

- The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an _“Up to…”_ stepper, going from 2 to 12.
- The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
- You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.

🚧

## [Day 36](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/36) - Project 7, Part One

- Why `@State` only works with structs
- Sharing SwiftUI state with `@StateObject`
- Showing and hiding views
- Deleting items using `onDelete()`
- Storing user settings with `UserDefaults`
- Archiving Swift objects with Codable

[Code](Projects/iExpense)

## [Day 37](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/37) - Project 7, Part Two

- Building a list we can delete from
- Working with `Identifiable` items in SwiftUI
- Sharing an observed object with a new view
- Making changes permanent with `UserDefaults`
- Final polish

[Code](Projects/iExpense)

## [Day 38](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/38) - Project 7, Part Three

1. Use the user’s preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars.
2. Modify the expense amounts in `ContentView` to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.
3. For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means being careful about how items are deleted!

[Code](Projects/iExpense)

## [Day 39](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/39) - Project 8, Part One

- Resizing images to fit the screen using `GeometryReader`
- How `ScrollView` lets us work with scrolling data
- Pushing new views onto the stack using `NavigationLink`

[Code](Projects/Moonshot)

## [Day 40](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/40) - Project 8, Part Two

- Loading a specific kind of `Codable` data
- Using generics to load any kind of `Codable` data
- Formatting our mission view

[Code](Projects/Moonshot)

## [Day 41](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/41) - Project 8, Part Three

- Showing mission details with [`ScrollView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scrollview) and [`GeometryReader`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/geometryreader)
- Merging [`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) structs
- Finishing up with one last view

[Code](Projects/Moonshot)

## [Day 42](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/42) - Project 8, Part Four

1. Add the launch date to `MissionView`, below the mission badge. You might choose to format this differently given that more space is available, but it’s down to you.
2. Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in `MissionView` is a great candidate, but if you followed my styling then you could also move the `Rectangle` dividers out too.
3. For a tough challenge, add a toolbar item to `ContentView` that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list.

[Code](Projects/Moonshot)

## [Day 43](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/43) - Project 9, Part One

- Animating simple shapes with `animatableData` (commit [`618b146d`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/618b146d4a389dc05b560136f42d8eb187c9c97a))
- Animating complex shapes with `AnimatablePair` (commit [`507b626b`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/507b626b37cba7ec2b00209058f581004d654712))

[Code](Projects/Drawing)

## [Day 46](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/46) - Project 9, Part Four

1. Create an `Arrow` shape – having it point straight up is fine. This could be a rectangle/triangle-style arrow, or perhaps three lines, or maybe something else depending on what kind of arrow you want to draw. (commit [`5326dfd2`](https://github.com/cdalvaro/hacking-with-swift/commit/5326dfd23390c434242e505c2f6ea7fd9f4e8e37))
