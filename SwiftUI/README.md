## [Day 19](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19) - Unit Conversions Challenge

You need to build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit
and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.

[Code](Challenges/UnitConversions)

## [Day 20](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/20) - Project 2, Part One

## [Day 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/22) - Project 2, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. Add an `@State` property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert.
2. Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags.
3. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message.

[Code](Projects/GuessTheFlag)

## [Days 23](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/23) and [24](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/24) - Project 3

*Challenge*

1. Create a custom `ViewModifier` (and accompanying `View` extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view. [Code](Projects/ViewsAndModifiers)
2. Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip. [Code](Projects/WeSplit)
3. Go back to project 2 and create a `FlagImage()` view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had. [Code](Projects/GuessTheFlag)

## [Day 25](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/25) - MILESTONE: Projects 1-3

Your challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at _rock, paper, scissors_.

So, very roughly:

- Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
- Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
- The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
- If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
- The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.

So, if the app chose _“Rock”_ and _“Win”_ the player would need to choose _“Paper”_, but if the app chose _“Rock”_ and _“Lose”_ the player would need to choose _“Scissors”_.

[Code](Milestones/Milestone-Projects1_3)

## [Day 26](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/26) - Project 4, Part One

- Entering numbers with `Stepper`.
- Selecting dates and times with `DatePicker`.
- Working with dates.
- Training a model with [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml).

[Code](Projects/BetterRest)

## [Day 27](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/27) - Project 4, Part Two

- Building a basic layout.
- Connecting SwiftUI to [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml).
- Cleaning up the user interface.
