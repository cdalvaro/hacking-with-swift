*Challenge*

1. Use Interface Builder to select the text label inside your table view cell and adjust its font size to something larger – experiment and see what looks good.
1. In your main table view, show the image names in sorted order, so “nssl0033.jpg” comes before “nssl0034.jpg”.
1. Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show “Picture X of Y”,
   where Y is the total number of images and X is the selected picture’s position in the array.
   Make sure you count from 1 rather than 0.

[Code](Projects/Project1)

*Challenge*

1. Try showing the player’s score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.
1. Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10. This should show their final score.
1. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.

[Code](Projects/Project2)

## [Day 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/22) - Project 3

*About technique projects* and *`UIActivityViewController` explained*.

*Challenge*

1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared.
   The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely.
   Note: Facebook won’t let you share text, but most other share options will.
2. Go back to project 1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.
3. Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.

[Code](Projects/Project3)

## [Day 23](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/23) - MILESTONE: Projects 1-3

*Challenge*

The challenge is to create an app that lists various world flags in a table view.

When one of them is tapped, slide in a detail view controller that contains an image view,
showing the same flag full size. On the detail view controller,
add an action button that lets the user share the flag picture and country name using `UIActivityViewController`.

[Code](Milestones/Milestone-Projects1_3)

## [Day 26](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/26) - Project 4, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. If users try to visit a URL that isn’t allowed, show an alert saying it’s blocked.
2. Try making two new toolbar items with the titles Back and Forward.
   You should make them use `webView.goBack` and `webView.goForward`.
3. For more of a challenge, try changing the initial view controller to a table view like in project 1,
   where users can choose their website from a list rather than just having the first in the array loaded up front.

[Code](Projects/Project4)

## [Day 27](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/27) - Project 5, Part One

*Setting up*, *Reading from disk: `contentsOfFile`* and *Pick a word, any word: `UIAllertController`*.

[Code](Projects/Project5)

## [Day 28](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/28) - Project 5, Part Two

[Code](Projects/Project5)

## [Day 29](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/29) - Project 5, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
2. Refactor all the `else` statements we just added so that they call a new method called `showErrorMessage()`.
3. Add a left bar button item that calls `startGame()`, so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.

* *Bonus*: Fix a bug that happens when you introduce the same word with and without uppercase letters.

[Code](Projects/Project5)

## [Day 30](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/30) - Project 6, Part One

*Setting up*, *Advanced Auto Layout* and *Auto Layout in code: `addConstraints()` with Visual Format Language*.

[Code](Projects/Project6a)

## [Day 31](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/31) - Project 6, Part Two

*Auto Layout metrics and priorities: constraints(withVisualFormat:)*, *Auto Layout anchors* and *Wrap up*.

[Code](Projects/Project6b)

## [Day 32](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/32) - MILESTONE: Projects 4-6

*Challenge*

The challenge is to create an app that lets people create a shopping list by adding items to a table view.

[Code](Milestones/Milestone-Projects4_6)

2. Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered. Use a `UIAlertController` with a text field to let them enter that string. This is a tough one, so I’ve included some hints below if you get stuck.

[Code](Projects/Project7)

## [Day 36](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/36) - Project 8, Part One

*Setting up* and *Building a UIKit user interface programmatically*.

2. Use `picker.sourceType = .camera` when creating your image picker.
3. Modify project 1 so that it uses a collection view controller rather than a table view controller.

[Code](Projects/Project10)

## [Day 45](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/45) - Project 11, Part One

Falling boxes with `SKSpriteNode`, `UITouch` and `SKPhysicsBody`.

[Code](Projects/Project11)

## [Day 46](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/46) - Project 11, Part Two

*Challenge*

1. Modify project 1 so that it remembers how many times each storm image was shown. [Code](Projects/Project1-UserDefaults)
2. Modify project 2 so that it saves the player’s highest score, and shows a special message if their new score beat the previous high score. [Code](Projects/Project2-UserDefaults)
3. Modify project 5 so that it saves the current word and all the player’s entries to UserDefaults, then loads them back when the app launches. [Code](Projects/Project5-UserDefaults)

## [Day 50](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/50) - MILESTONE: Projects 10-12

*Challenge*

The challenge is to put two different projects into one: I’d like you to let users take photos of things that interest them, add captions to them, then show those photos in a table view. Tapping the caption should show the picture in a new view controller, like we did with project 1. So, your finished project needs to use elements from both project 1 and project 12, which should give you ample chance to practice.

[Code](Milestones/Milestone-Projects10_12)

## [Day 51](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/51) - Expanding Your Horizons

No code today! Instead, two interesting videos about `map()`, `flatMap()` and `filter()`.

- [Elements of Functional Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgU8d_E1K14)
- [Teaching Swift at Scale](https://vimeo.com/291590798)

## [Day 52](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/52) - Project 13, Part One

Designing the interface and importing pictures from photo library.

[Code](Projects/Project13)

## [Day 53](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/53) - Project 13, Part Two

Applying filters: `CIContext`, `CIFilter` and saving to the iOS photo library.

[Code](Projects/Project13)

## [Day 54](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/54) - Project 13, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. Try making the _Save_ button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
2. Make the _Change Filter_ button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
3. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.

[Code](Projects/Project13)

## [Day 55](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/55) - Project 14, Part One

Getting up and running: `SKCropNode` and Penguin, show thyself: `SKAction moveBy(x:y:duration:)`.

[Code](Projects/Project14)

## [Day 56](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/56) - Project 14, Part Two

Whack to win: `SKAction` sequences

*Challenge*

1. Record your own voice saying _"Game over!"_ and have it play when the game ends.
2. When showing _“Game Over”_ add an `SKLabelNode` showing their final score.
3. Use `SKEmitterNode` to create a smoke-like effect when penguins are hit, and a separate mud-like effect when they go into or come out of a hole.

[Code](Projects/Project14)

## [Day 57](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/57) - Project 15, Part One

Switch, case, animate: `animate(withDuration:)` and Transform: `CGAffineTransform`

[Code](Projects/Project15)

## [Day 58](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/58) - Project 15, Part Two

*Challenge*

1. Go back to project 8 and make the letter group buttons fade out when they are tapped.
We were using the `isHidden` property, but you'll need to switch to `alpha` because `isHidden` is either `true` or `false`, it has no animatable values between. [Code](Projects/Project8-CGAffineTransform)
2. Go back to project 13 and make the image view fade in when a new picture is chosen.
To make this work, set the `alpha` to 0 first. [Code](Projects/Project13-CGAffineTransform)
3. Go back to project 2 and make the flags scale down with a little bounce when pressed. [Code](Projects/Project2-CGAffineTransform)

## [Day 59](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/59) - MILESTONE: Projects 13-15

*Challenge*

Your challenge is to make an app that contains facts about countries: show a list of country names in a table view, then when one is tapped bring in a new screen that contains its capital city, size, population, currency, and any other facts that interest you. The type of facts you include is down to you – Wikipedia has a huge selection to choose from.

[Code](Milestones/Milestone-Projects13_15)

## [Day 60](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/60) - Project 16, Part One

*Setting up*, *Up and running with* `MapKit` and *Annotations and accessory views:* `MKPinAnnotationView`

[Code](Projects/Project16)

## [Day 61](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/61) - Project 16, Part Two

*Challenge*

1. Try typecasting the return value from `dequeueReusableAnnotationView()` so that it's an `MKPinAnnotationView`.
Once that’s done, change the `pinTintColor` property to your favorite `UIColor`.
2. Add a `UIAlertController` that lets users specify how they want to view the map.
There's a `mapType` property that draws the maps in different ways.
For example, `.satellite` gives a satellite view of the terrain.
3. Modify the callout button so that pressing it shows a new view controller with a web view,
taking users to the Wikipedia entry for that city.

[Code](Projects/Project16)

## [Day 62](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/62) - Project 17, Part One

*Setting up*, *Space: the final frontier*, *Bring on the enemies:* `linearDamping`, `angularDamping` and *Making contact:* `didBegin()`

[Code](Projects/Project17)
