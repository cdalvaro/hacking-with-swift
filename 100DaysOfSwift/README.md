## [Day 18](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/18) - Project 1, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. Use Interface Builder to select the text label inside your table view cell and adjust its font size to something larger – experiment and see what looks good.
1. In your main table view, show the image names in sorted order, so “nssl0033.jpg” comes before “nssl0034.jpg”.
1. Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show “Picture X of Y”,
   where Y is the total number of images and X is the selected picture’s position in the array.
   Make sure you count from 1 rather than 0.

[Code](Project1)

## [Day 19](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/19) - Project 2, Part One

*Setting up*, *Designing your layout* and *Making the basic game work: `UIButton` and `CALayer`*

## [Day 20](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/20) - Project 2, Part Two

*Guess which flag: random numbers* and *From outlets to actions: creating an `IBAction`*

[Code](Project2)

## [Day 21](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/21) - Project 2, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. Try showing the player’s score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.
1. Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10. This should show their final score.
1. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.

[Code](Project2)

## [Day 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/22) - Project 3

*About technique projects* and *`UIActivityViewController` explained*

*Challenge*

1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared.
   The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely.
   Note: Facebook won’t let you share text, but most other share options will.
2. Go back to project 1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.
3. Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.

[Code](Project3)

## [Day 23](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/23) - MILESTONE: Projects 1-3

*Challenge*

The challenge is to create an app that lists various world flags in a table view.

When one of them is tapped, slide in a detail view controller that contains an image view,
showing the same flag full size. On the detail view controller,
add an action button that lets the user share the flag picture and country name using `UIActivityViewController`.
