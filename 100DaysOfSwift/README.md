## [Day 18](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/18) - Project 1, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. Use Interface Builder to select the text label inside your table view cell and adjust its font size to something larger – experiment and see what looks good.
1. In your main table view, show the image names in sorted order, so “nssl0033.jpg” comes before “nssl0034.jpg”.
1. Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show “Picture X of Y”,
   where Y is the total number of images and X is the selected picture’s position in the array.
   Make sure you count from 1 rather than 0.

[Code](Project1)

## [Day 19](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/19) - Project 2, Part One

*Setting up*, *Designing your layout* and *Making the basic game work: `UIButton` and `CALayer`*

[Code](Project2)

## [Day 20](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/20) - Project 2, Part Two

*Guess which flag: random numbers* and *From outlets to actions: creating an `IBAction`*

[Code](Project2)

## [Day 21](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/21) - Project 2, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. Try showing the player’s score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.
1. Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10. This should show their final score.
1. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.

[Code](Project2)

## [Day 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/22) - Project 3

*About technique projects* and *`UIActivityViewController` explained*

*Challenge*

1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared.
   The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely.
   Note: Facebook won’t let you share text, but most other share options will.
2. Go back to project 1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.
3. Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.

[Code](Project3)

## [Day 23](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/23) - MILESTONE: Projects 1-3

*Challenge*

The challenge is to create an app that lists various world flags in a table view.

When one of them is tapped, slide in a detail view controller that contains an image view,
showing the same flag full size. On the detail view controller,
add an action button that lets the user share the flag picture and country name using `UIActivityViewController`.

## [Day 24](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/24) - Project 4, Part One

*Setting up*, *Creating a simple browser with `WKWebView`* and *Choosing a website: `UIAlertController` action sheets*

## [Day 25](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/25) - Project 4, Part Two

*Monitoring page loads: `UIToolBar` and `UIProgressView`* and *Refactoring for the win*

## [Day 26](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/26) - Project 4, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. If users try to visit a URL that isn’t allowed, show an alert saying it’s blocked.
2. Try making two new toolbar items with the titles Back and Forward.
   You should make them use `webView.goBack` and `webView.goForward`.
3. For more of a challenge, try changing the initial view controller to a table view like in project 1,
   where users can choose their website from a list rather than just having the first in the array loaded up front.

## [Day 27](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/27) - Project 5, Part One

*Setting up*, *Reading from disk: `contentsOfFile`* and *Pick a word, any word: `UIAllertController`*

## [Day 28](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/28) - Project 5, Part Two

*Prepare for submission: `lowercased()` and `IndexPath`*, *Checking for valid answers* and *Or else what?*

## [Day 29](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/29) - Project 5, Part Three

*Challenge*

1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
2. Refactor all the `else` statements we just added so that they call a new method called `showErrorMessage()`.
3. Add a left bar button item that calls `startGame()`, so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.

* *Bonus*: Fix a bug that happens when you introduce the same word with and without uppercase letters.

## [Day 30](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/30) - Project 6, Part One

*Setting up*, *Advanced Auto Layout* and *Auto Layout in code: `addConstraints()` with Visual Format Language*

## [Day 31](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/31) - Project 6, Part Two

*Auto Layout metrics and priorities: constraints(withVisualFormat:)*, *Auto Layout anchors* and *Wrap up*.

## [Day 32](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/32) - MILESTONE: Projects 4-6

*Challenge*

The challenge is to create an app that lets people create a shopping list by adding items to a table view.

## [Day 33](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/33) - Project 7, Part One

*Creating the basic UI: `UITabBarController`* and *Parsing JSON using the `Codable` protocol*
